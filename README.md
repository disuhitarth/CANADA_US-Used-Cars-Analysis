# US/CANADA USED CARS Analysis

Due to pandemics, public transportation has become risky so we want to look at the current used car market in CANADA & USA. ​

Our goal is to see the brands, market presence, price, and popularity in both countries by querying the dataset.​

This will help anyone who wishes to buy a used car at a reasonable price.​

We also want to analyze and compare the current market of the United States and Canada as of 2021.​
